JSZip is third party library for LZ compression. 

It is independent on TreeGrid. It is distributed under MIT or GPLv3 license.
It can be downloaded or its licensing read at https://stuk.github.io/jszip/

It is loaded by TreeGrid only for client export to XLSX. 
To not use it at all, set <Cfg JSZip='0'/>, in this case the export will produce longer uncompressed XLSX files.

js.zip.min.js is the latest version with asynchronous usage
js.zip.min.sync.js is version 2.6. with synchronous usage, if grid has set Sync='1', required for printing to pdf
